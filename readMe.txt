Fantasy PL machine learning predictor.

In 16_17.ipynb I tested each player 2016-17 performance with their points in the 2017-2018 season. The model tried to [redict if the score was above a certain threshold.

16_17.py is the python file with the same exact code (so that I can run from the terminal) with a for loop to iterate through different number of neighbors in the knn algorithm.
